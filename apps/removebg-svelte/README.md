# Simple remove background app using Cloudinary AI

>[!note]
>Clodinary API requires an API but offers a generous free tier. You can try this app yourself by cloning the repo and adding your Cloudname and API Key in an env file

# Implementation
Makes use of [`dropzone`](https://www.dropzone.dev/) library for handling file upload. Cloudinary SDK helps with url manipulation.
[`two-up`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/two-up) web component is used for comparison after removal.
